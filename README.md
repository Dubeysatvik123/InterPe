Car Price Predictor
📊 Overview

This project involves a Car Price Predictor developed using machine learning techniques and Streamlit. The goal is to predict the price of a car based on various features such as year, kilometers driven, company, and fuel type. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and the creation of an interactive user interface.
🛠️ Features

    Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the dataset by handling non-numeric values and converting categorical features into numerical representations.
    Model Training: Utilizes a RandomForestRegressor to predict car prices, showcasing the application of machine learning algorithms.
    Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit, allowing users to input car details and receive instant price predictions.
    Performance Evaluation: Includes evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model accuracy.

📁 Contents

    car_price_predictor.py: The main script for training the model and creating the Streamlit app.
    requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages required to run the project.
    data/: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
